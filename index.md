# Hi, I'm Ryan.
*Welcome to my User Page!* I'm a second-year **Computer Science major** with a **minor in Business** here at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/).

As a programmer, I enjoy learning new things! During my roughly *6 years* of experience in programming, I've worked with the following languages:
- C
- C#
- C++
- Java
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Flash
- Python
- Assembly

For those who may not be familiar with programming, each language contains different syntax. For example, to print to the console in Java, we would write:

`System.out.println("Hello World!");`

While to print to the console in C++, we would write:

`cout << "Hello World!";`

My interest in the field began with a 4-year program I took throughout high school called [Global IT Academy](https://bohs.bousd.us/apps/pages/GITA) (or GITA, for short). I enjoyed learning the basics of programming as well as how to collaborate with others on coding projects. My teacher through all of GITA, Todd Salesky, was famous for the quote:

> "It's a workday, folks!"

Since then, I've of course been studying computer science here at UCSD. I'm not exactly sure what I would like to do professionally at this point, but I'm hoping that through experiences such as taking classes on new topics or interning in a professional setting will help me decide. I look forward to learning all about Software Engineering in CSE 110!

Outside of school, I like to spend my time on the following hobbies (ranked in order of enjoyment)
1. Playing video games
2. Listening to/producing music
3. Surfing
4. Hiking
5. Watching TV shows/movies

I try to get outside as much as I can, but sometimes it can get difficult since school can be pretty time consuming. Though I'm not able to hike often, it's still one of my favorite things to do. The following is a list of national parks in California that I've visited and would still like to visit:
- [x] Yosemite
- [ ] Pinnacles
- [x] Joshua Tree
- [ ] Sequoia
- [x] Redwood

Additionally, my favorite video game of all time is called Hollow Knight. I definitely recommend you try it out!

That's just a brief introduction about who I am. If you'd like to learn more about me or talk about anything else in particular, feel free to shoot me an e-mail at **rseidl@ucsd.edu**.
